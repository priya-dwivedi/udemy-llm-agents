      " The two trains will meet 704 km away from City A.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's the step-by-step solution:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Let x be the distance the first train travels before the second train starts moving. Since the second train starts 2 hours later, the first train has been traveling for 2 hours when the second train starts.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. The first train travels at a speed of 120 km/h, so in 2 hours, it covers a distance of 120 * 2 = 240 km. Therefore, x = 960 - 240 = 720 km.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Now, both trains are moving towards each other. Their combined speed is 120 + 80 = 200 km/h.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. To find the time it takes for them to meet, we can use the formula: time = distance / combined speed. So, time = 720 / 200 = 3.6 hours.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Since the first train was already traveling for 2 hours when the second train started, the additional time it takes for them to meet is 3.6 - 2 = 1.6 hours.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. During this additional 1.6 hours, the first train travels at a speed of 120 km/h. So, the distance it covers in this time is 120 * 1.6 = 192 km.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. The final distance between City A and the meeting point is the initial distance the first train traveled (x) plus the additional distance it covered (192 km). So, the distance is 720 + 192 = 912 km. However, this is the distance from City A to the point where the trains would have met if they had continued moving at their constant speeds. Since the slower train is still moving towards this point, we need to subtract the distance it would have traveled in the additional 1.6 hours.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. The slower train travels at a speed of 80 km/h, so in 1.6 hours, it covers a distance of 80 * 1.6 = 128 km.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. Subtracting this distance from the initial calculated distance gives us the final answer: 912 - 128 = 784 km. However, since we made an error in our initial calculation (the trains do not actually meet at this point due to the slower train's speed decreasing as it approaches the meeting point), we need to correct this error.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. To correct the error, we can use the formula for the relative speed of the two trains: relative speed = (first train's speed - second train's speed) / (1 + (first train's speed / second train's speed)). In this case, the relative speed is (120 - 80) / (1 + 120/80) = 40 km/h.\n",
      "\n",
      "11. Now, we can use the formula for the time it takes for them to meet with their relative speed: time = distance / relative speed. So, time = 720 / 40 = 18 hours.\n",
      "\n",
      "12. Since the first train was already traveling for 2 hours when the second train started, the additional time it takes for them to meet is 18 - 2 = 16 hours.\n",
      "\n",
      "13. During this additional 16 hours, the first train travels at a speed of 120 km/h. So, the distance it covers in this time is 120 *\n"

By creating self-sufficient habitats, we can ensure the survival and well-being of future Martian colonists. The partnerships with private space companies and international space agencies offer a collaborative approach to leveraging expertise and resources for this ambitious goal.\\n\\nThe second solution of reusable spacecraft for supply missions is ranked second as it offers a practical and cost-effective way to support ongoing missions to Mars. By investing in reusable technology, we can reduce the overall cost of space exploration and make missions more sustainable in the long run. The collaboration with commercial space companies and other space agencies provides a solid foundation for developing and testing this innovative approach.\\n\\nThe third solution of resource extraction and processing facilities on Mars is ranked third due to the challenges and uncertainties associated with setting up and maintaining such facilities on the planet. While the potential for valuable resource discovery is promising, the technical and logistical hurdles may prove to be significant obstacles. However, partnerships with mining companies and technology firms could help overcome these challenges and lead to unexpected advancements in resource utilization.\\n\\nIn conclusion, each solution offers unique opportunities and challenges for advancing human exploration and habitation on Mars. By prioritizing sustainable habitat development and reusable spacecraft technology, we can pave the way for a successful and sustainable future on the Red Planet. Collaboration and innovation will be key to overcoming the obstacles and realizing the full potential of these solutions.'}\n"
