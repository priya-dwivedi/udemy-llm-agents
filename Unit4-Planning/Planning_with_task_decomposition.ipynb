      "1. Let x be the distance the faster train travels in the two hours before the slower train starts moving.\n",
      "2. In those two hours, the slower train remains stationary, so the combined distance the faster train travels is equal to the distance between the cities minus the distance the slower train needs to travel to meet the faster train.\n",
      "3. So, we have the equation: 120t + 120(2) = 960 - 80(t - 2), where t is the time in hours it takes for the trains to meet after both start moving.\n",
      "4. Simplifying the equation, we get: 120t + 240 = 960 - 80t + 160.\n",
      "5. Combining like terms, we get: 240 + 80t = 960 - 120t.\n",
      "6. Solving for t, we get: t = (960 - 240) / (120 + 80) = 720 / 200 = 3.6 hours.\n",
      "7. Now that we know the time it takes for the trains to meet, we can find the distance the faster train travels before the slower train starts moving: 120 * 3.6 = 432 km.\n",
