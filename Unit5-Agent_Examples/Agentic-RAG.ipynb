       "'Published: 2024-06-09\\nTitle: RATT: A Thought Structure for Coherent and Correct LLM Reasoning\\nAuthors: Jinghan Zhang, Xiting Wang, Weijieying Ren, Lu Jiang, Dongjie Wang, Kunpeng Liu\\nSummary: Large Language Models (LLMs) gain substantial reasoning and decision-making\\ncapabilities from thought structures. However, existing methods such as Tree of\\nThought and Retrieval Augmented Thoughts often fall short in complex tasks due\\nto the limitations of insufficient local retrieval of factual knowledge and\\ninadequate global selection of strategies. These limitations make it\\nchallenging for these methods to balance factual accuracy and comprehensive\\nlogical optimization effectively. To address these limitations, we introduce\\nthe Retrieval Augmented Thought Tree (RATT), a novel thought structure that\\nconsiders both overall logical soundness and factual correctness at each step\\nof the thinking process. Specifically, at every point of a thought branch, RATT\\nperforms planning and lookahead to explore and evaluate multiple potential\\nreasoning steps, and integrate the fact-checking ability of Retrieval-Augmented\\nGeneration (RAG) with LLM\\'s ability to assess overall strategy. Through this\\ncombination of factual knowledge and strategic feasibility, the RATT adjusts\\nand integrates the thought tree structure to search for the most promising\\nbranches within the search space. This thought structure significantly enhances\\nthe model\\'s coherence in logical inference and efficiency in decision-making,\\nand thus increases the limit of the capacity of LLM to generate reliable\\ninferences and decisions based on thought structures. A broad range of\\nexperiments on different types of tasks showcases that the RATT structure\\nsignificantly outperforms existing methods in factual correctness and logical\\ncoherence.\\n\\nPublished: 2024-02-23\\nTitle: Everything of Thoughts: Defying the Law of Penrose Triangle for Thought Generation\\nAuthors: Ruomeng Ding, Chaoyun Zhang, Lu Wang, Yong Xu, Minghua Ma, Wei Zhang, Si Qin, Saravan Rajmohan, Qingwei Lin, Dongmei Zhang\\nSummary: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized\\ndecision-making by breaking down complex problems into more manageable language\\nsequences referred to as \"thoughts\". An effective thought design should\\nconsider three key perspectives: performance, efficiency, and flexibility.\\nHowever, existing thought can at most exhibit two of these attributes. To\\naddress these limitations, we introduce a novel thought prompting approach\\ncalled \"Everything of Thoughts\" (XoT) to defy the law of \"Penrose triangle of\\nexisting thought paradigms. XoT leverages pretrained reinforcement learning and\\nMonte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to incorporate external domain knowledge into\\nthoughts, thereby enhancing LLMs\\' capabilities and enabling them to generalize\\nto unseen problems efficiently. Through the utilization of the MCTS-LLM\\ncollaborative thought revision framework, this approach autonomously produces\\nhigh-quality comprehensive cognitive mappings with minimal LLM interactions.\\nAdditionally, XoT empowers LLMs to engage in unconstrained thinking, allowing\\nfor flexible cognitive mappings for problems with multiple solutions. We\\nevaluate XoT on several challenging multi-solution problem-solving tasks,\\nincluding Game of 24, 8-Puzzle, and Pocket Cube. Our results demonstrate that\\nXoT significantly outperforms existing approaches. Notably, XoT can yield\\nmultiple solutions with just one LLM call, showcasing its remarkable\\nproficiency in addressing complex problems across diverse domains.\\n\\nPublished: 2023-09-14\\nTitle: Tree of Uncertain Thoughts Reasoning for Large Language Models\\nAuthors: Shentong Mo, Miao Xin\\nSummary: While the recently introduced Tree of Thoughts (ToT) has heralded\\nadvancements in allowing Large Language Models (LLMs) to reason through\\nforesight and backtracking for global decision-making, it has overlooked the\\ninherent local uncertainties in intermediate decision points or \"thoughts\".\\nThese local uncertainties, intrinsic to LLMs given their potential for diverse\\nresponses, remain a significant concern in the reasoning process. Addressing\\nthis pivotal gap, we introduce the Tree of Uncertain Thoughts (TouT) - a\\nreasoning framework tailored for LLMs. Our TouT effectively leverages Monte\\nCarlo Dropout to quantify uncertainty scores associated with LLMs\\' diverse\\nlocal responses at these intermediate steps. By marrying this local uncertainty\\nquantification with global search algorithms, TouT enhances the model\\'s\\nprecision in response generation. We substantiate our approach with rigorous\\nexperiments on two demanding planning tasks: Game of 24 and Mini Crosswords.\\nThe empirical evidence underscores TouT\\'s superiority over both ToT and\\nchain-of-thought prompting methods.'"

However, along with testing on more complex reasoning, these\\nmethods also expose problems such as invalid reasoning and fictional reasoning\\npaths. In this paper, we develop \\\\textit{Hypothesis Testing Prompting}, which\\nadds conclusion assumptions, backward reasoning, and fact verification during\\nintermediate reasoning steps. \\\\textit{Hypothesis Testing prompting} involves\\nmultiple assumptions and reverses validation of conclusions leading to its\\nunique correct answer. Experiments on two challenging deductive reasoning\\ndatasets ProofWriter and RuleTaker show that hypothesis testing prompting not\\nonly significantly improves the effect, but also generates a more reasonable\\nand standardized reasoning process.\\n\\nPublished: 2023-10-09\\nTitle: Guiding Large Language Models via Directional Stimulus Prompting\\nAuthors: Zekun Li, Baolin Peng, Pengcheng He, Michel Galley, Jianfeng Gao, Xifeng Yan\\nSummary: We introduce Directional Stimulus Prompting, a novel framework for guiding\\nblack-box large language models (LLMs) toward specific desired outputs. Instead\\nof directly adjusting LLMs, our method employs a small tunable policy model\\n(e.g., T5) to generate an auxiliary directional stimulus prompt for each input\\ninstance. These directional stimulus prompts act as nuanced, instance-specific\\nhints and clues to guide LLMs in generating desired outcomes, such as including\\nspecific keywords in the generated summary. Our approach sidesteps the\\nchallenges of direct LLM tuning by optimizing the policy model to explore\\ndirectional stimulus prompts that align LLMs with desired behaviors. The policy\\nmodel can be optimized through 1) supervised fine-tuning using labeled data and\\n2) reinforcement learning from offline or online rewards based on the LLM\\'s\\noutput. We assess our method across summarization, dialogue response\\ngeneration, and chain-of-thought reasoning tasks. Our experiments demonstrate\\nthat the framework consistently improves LLMs\\' (e.g., ChatGPT, Codex,\\nInstructGPT) performance on these supervised tasks using minimal labeled data.\\nNotably, using just 80 dialogues on the MultiWOZ dataset, our approach enhances\\nChatGPT\\'s performance by an impressive 41.4%, matching or surpassing some fully\\nsupervised start-of-the-art models. Additionally, the instance-specific\\nchain-of-thought prompt generated by our approach improves InstructGPT\\'s\\nreasoning accuracy compared to human-crafted or automatically generated\\nprompts.

While\\nchain-of-thought can lead to dramatic performance gains, benefits appear to\\nemerge only for sufficiently large models (beyond 50B parameters). We show that\\norders-of-magnitude smaller models (125M -- 1.3B parameters) can still benefit\\nfrom chain-of-thought prompting. To achieve this, we introduce Symbolic\\nChain-of-Thought Distillation (SCoTD), a method to train a smaller student\\nmodel on rationalizations sampled from a significantly larger teacher model.\\nExperiments across several commonsense benchmarks show that: 1) SCoTD enhances\\nthe performance of the student model in both supervised and few-shot settings,\\nand especially for challenge sets; 2) sampling many reasoning chains per\\ninstance from the teacher is paramount; and 3) after distillation, student\\nchain-of-thoughts are judged by humans as comparable to the teacher, despite\\norders of magnitude fewer parameters. We test several hypotheses regarding what\\nproperties of chain-of-thought samples are important, e.g., diversity vs.\\nteacher likelihood vs. open-endedness.
